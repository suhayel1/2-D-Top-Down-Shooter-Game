# 2-D-Top-Down-Shooter-Game

A simple game I made back in April 2022 using HTML+CSS+JS.

A 2-D game with top-down view camera where player moves around and shoots an endless wave of enemies.

Includes:
- Start menu that allows the player to start the game
- Restart menu that displays final score and allows player to play another round
- Heads-up display that includes health bar and points, and current score
- Blood particle effect when enemy gets shot and/or killed

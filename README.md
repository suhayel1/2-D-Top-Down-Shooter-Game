# 2-D-Top-Down-Shooter-Game

A simple game I made back in April 2022 using HTML+CSS+JS.

I used this YouTube video as a guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI9idPTT0c4 (Chris Courses: HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript Game Tutorial)

Despite using a YT video for assistance, I tried to make a fair number of modifications/additions (to code, visuals, and functionality/features) so that the game was closer to my vision, so I wouldn't call it a direct copy-and-paste of the game in the video.

Some unique things I've done to match game with my vision:
- Added a health bar at the top of the heads-up display that gets visually updated whenever an enemy collides with player, causing HP value to decrease the more/longer enemy makes contact with player, and the bar goes from fully green to fully red with each HP lost
- Added blood particle effect where when a bullet hits an enemy, the effect will start from that collision point and spread in a cone shape; also when enemy dies, a blood explosion occurs

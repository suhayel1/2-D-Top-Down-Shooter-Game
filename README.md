# 2-D-Top-Down-Shooter-Game

A simple game I made back in April 2022 using HTML+CSS+JS.

I used this YouTube video as a guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI9idPTT0c4 (Chris Courses: HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript Game Tutorial)

Despite using a YT video for assistance, I tried to make a fair number of modifications/additions (to both code and visuals) so that the game was closer to my vision, so I wouldn't call it a direct copy-and-paste of the game in the video.
